# PeptoVarDB

PeptoVarDB - human peptide annotation database for immunology: [www.peptovar.online](www.peptovar.online)

## Overview

PeptoVarDB is an on-line database of annotated peptides based on human genome annotation and public data of human genome common variants created with PeptoVar program in the pupulation mode.
PeptoVar (Peptides of Variations) is a program for annotation of genomic variants in protein coding genes and generation of annotated peptides: [https://open-projects.github.io/PeptoVar/](https://open-projects.github.io/PeptoVar/).
The main idea of PeptoVar is implementation of the potential compound effects of combining alternate alleles across multiple variant loci in sequence translation.
PeptoVar is helpful for in-silico prediction of new minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHa), simulation of stem sells transplantation 
or as peptide database generator for shotgun proteomic studies of immunopeptidome.

## The project was developed under the research project supported by RFBR, the project number 17-04-02186.
